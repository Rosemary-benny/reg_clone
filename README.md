# reg_clone
This is the code for the clone of a part of TinkerHub Registration Page made using HTML, NODEJS and MongoDB.
This was made to collect data and show the demo of a bot project that requires similar info.

P.S. 
TinkerHub Membership ID is provided by them. This one is just for the demo purpose.
